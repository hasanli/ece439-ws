## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to evoke a sense of calm and neutrality. Lavender is chosen because it balances the energy of red and the serenity of blue, symbolizing a harmonious blend of traditionally gendered colors.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) to ensure content is readable and reduce distraction.
- Accent color: Muted coral (#F08080) to highlight important information. The use of a warmer, yet subdued tone is approachable and not overtly feminine.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for readability and a modern feel.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif that looks contemporary, used in headers for short and engaging presentation.
- Simple, gender-neutral icons to illustrate points and advice; icons should use the muted coral color for emphasis.
- Clean and organized layout, dividing information into concise, digestible sections. Use of white space to avoid overwhelming the visitor.
